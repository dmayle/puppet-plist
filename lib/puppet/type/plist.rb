  Manage single keys inside a plist file.

  This resource type is primarily intended where you want control over a single key and value inside a plist file, and
  where the value is a simple non-hierarchical value such as an integer or string.

  The path to the plist and the key that you would like to modify are constructed similar to the PlistBuddy(8) command
  line utility, eg, if i want to change the value of a key called childkey in file.plist, the name of the resource would
  be like this:

  /full/path/to/file.plist:parentkey:childkey

  - The full path to the .plist file comes first.
  - Then a colon indicates the root of the plist dictionary.
  - And finally the name of the key in the plist we want to change.
  - If the key is a child of the value of another key, use colons to separate the key names (or indexes).
